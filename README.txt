Hi,

These are the programs I created for the Cansat Competition (2022-2023). 
One collection of programs uses the csv data to plot animated graphs and the other uses the data to predict CO2 values across the country.
Please do not directly copy my code to use for your own project - instead implement aspects of it as and where you need to.
You will need to alter the file locations called at the start of each file in order for the programs to run successfully.
